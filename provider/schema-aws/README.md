# Schema Service
The OSDU on AWS energy data platform registers new schemas describing ‘Kinds of data’ via the Schema Service.The Schema service enables easier creation, management and sharing of schemas.
The Schema service supports the deployment of ‘Shared’ as well as ‘Private’ schemas. ‘Shared’ schemas will help make teams aware of the different schemas being used and will facilitate reuse.
 

## Running Locally

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Pre-requisites

* JDK 17 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-17-ug/what-is-corretto-17.html)
* Maven 3.8.3 or later
* Lombok 1.18.26 or later
* OSDU Instance deployed on AWS

### Service Configuration
In order to run the service locally or remotely, you will need to have the following environment variables defined.

| name | example value | required | description | sensitive? |
| ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        | ---    |
| `APPLICATION_PORT` | `8080` | yes | The port the service will be hosted on. | no |
| `AWS_REGION` | `us-east-1` | yes | The region where resources needed by the service are deployed | no |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `ASIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` | yes | The AWS Access Key for a user with access to Backend Resources required by the service | yes |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `super-secret-key==` | yes | The AWS Secret Key for a user with access to Backend Resources required by the service | yes |
| `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | `session-token-xxxxxxxxxx` | no | AWS Session token needed if using an SSO user session to authenticate | yes |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `osdu-prefix` | yes | The Resource Prefix defined during deployment | no |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `DEBUG` | yes | The Log Level severity to use (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/log4j_logging_levels.htm) | no |
| `SSM_ENABLED` | `true` | yes | Set to 'true' to use SSM to resolve config properties, otherwise use env vars | no |
| `SSL_ENABLED` | `false` | no | Set to 'false' to disable SSL for local development | no |
| `ENTITLEMENTS_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8081` or `https://some-hosted-url` | yes | Specify the base url for an entitlements service instance. Can be run locally or remote | no |
| `PARTITION_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8081` or `https://some-hosted-url` | yes | Specify the base url for a partitions service instance. Can be run locally or remote | no |



### Run Locally
Check that maven is installed:

example:
```bash
$ mvn --version
Apache Maven 3.8.3 (ff8e977a158738155dc465c6a97ffaf31982d739)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.8.3/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_312, vendor: Amazon.com Inc., runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/amazon-corretto-8.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
...
```

You may need to configure access to the remote maven repository that holds the OSDU dependencies. Copy one of the below files' content to your .m2 folder
* For development against the OSDU GitLab environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>~/.mvn/community-maven.settings.xml`
* For development in an AWS Environment, leverage: `<REPO_ROOT>/provider/schema-aws/maven/settings.xml`

* Navigate to the service's root folder and run:

```bash
mvn clean package -pl schema-core,provider/schema-aws
```

* If you wish to build the project without running tests

```bash
mvn clean package -pl schema-core,provider/schema-aws -DskipTests
```

After configuring your environment as specified above, you can follow these steps to run the application. These steps should be invoked from the *repository root.*
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: If not on osx/linux: Replace `*` with version numbers as defined in the provider/schema-aws/pom.xml file

```bash
java -jar provider/schema-aws/target/schema-aws-*.*.*-SNAPSHOT-spring-boot.jar
```

## Testing
 
 ### Running Integration Tests 
 This section describes how to run OSDU Integration tests (testing/schema-test-aws).
 
 You will need to have the following environment variables defined.
 
 | name | example value | description | sensitive?
 | ---  | ---   | ---         | ---        |
 | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | `ASIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` | The AWS Access Key for a user with access to Backend Resources required by the service | yes |
 | `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | `super-secret-key==` | The AWS Secret Key for a user with access to Backend Resources required by the service | yes |
 | `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | `session-token-xxxxxxxxx` | AWS Session token needed if using an SSO user session to authenticate | yes |
 | `SCHEMA_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | The url where the Schema API is hosted | no |  

  
 Execute following command to build code and run all the integration tests:

### Run Tests simulating Pipeline

* Prior to running tests, scripts must be executed locally to generate pipeline env vars

```bash
testing/schema-test-aws/build-aws/prepare-dist.sh

#Set Neccessary ENV Vars here as defined in run-tests.sh

dist/testing/integration/build-aws/run-tests.sh 
```

### Run Tests using mvn
Set required env vars and execute the following:
```
mvn clean package -f testing/pom.xml -pl schema-test-core -DskipTests
mvn verify -f testing/schema-test-core/pom.xml -Dcucumber.options="--plugin junit:target/junit-report.xml --tags @SchemaService"
```
